- normalizedLocation: the location standardized to a clean English format (e.g. "Bondor Bazar, Sylhet" instead of "সিলেট বন্দর বাজার" or "sylhet bondor bazar area"). Always use proper capitalization, remove informal words, and translate to English if needed.
- suggestedAction: recommended action for emergency responders in English
- confidence: a number between 0 and 1 representing your confidence in the classification
